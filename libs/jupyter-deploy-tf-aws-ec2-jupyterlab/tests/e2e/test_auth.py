"""E2E tests for the auth boundary — direct requests to the instance, no allowlist mutation.

This template's security model has no analogue in the base template. There is no OAuth, no public
URL, and no network fence: the security group opens ``:443`` to the world on purpose. The boundary
is (a) TLS pinned to a self-signed cert whose PEM is published to SSM, and (b) a Traefik ForwardAuth
sidecar that replays a presigned ``sts:GetCallerIdentity`` token and authorizes the ARN STS returns
against this deployment's IAM allowlists.

**Scope: this file only ever sends requests.** It never runs `jd users` / `jd teams`, so it needs no
allowlist snapshot, cannot lock the caller out, and is fast — nearly every case is rejected before
the sidecar makes any outbound call. The allowlist itself is exercised in ``test_teams.py`` (the
positive and negative paths for a role caller, which is what CI runs as) and ``test_users.py``.

The sidecar's contract is a status code, so these tests *are* the client: a stdlib HTTPS connection
trusting exactly the pinned PEM (``local_proxy.requests.pinned_request``). Driving them through the
real proxy would add a part that can mask the very status code under assertion.

Omitted: covered by the base template suite (`test_users.py`, `test_org_and_teams.py`)
  The GitHub-identity allowlist semantics (org membership, team membership, "cannot remove the last
  user while no org is allowlisted"). None of it applies: authorization here is by IAM role/user
  name within one AWS account, with no org/team concept and no such interlock.

Not testable here, and deliberately skipped:
  - **Cross-account** (an identically named role in another account, which ``allows()`` rejects on
    the ``accountID`` check) — needs a second AWS account.
  - **Non-role/non-user principals** (root, federated-user, service principal -> ``kind == ""`` ->
    403) — cannot be produced from the CI identity.
  - **503 on STS unavailability** — would require faulting STS.

  All three are pure ``config.allows`` / error-mapping logic with no I/O, so they belong in Go unit
  tests next to the sidecar. There is no `go test` target in this repo yet (see the note in
  ``template/services/auth-sidecar/main_test.go``), so they are currently uncovered — stated here
  rather than left implied.

Deliberately elsewhere:
  - ``test_cert_pin_stable_across_host_restart`` lives in ``test_host.py``, which owns the suite's
    single EC2 stop/start cycle.

How the tokens here are crafted
-------------------------------
A token is ``k8s-aws-v1.`` + base64url of a presigned ``sts:GetCallerIdentity`` URL. Its SigV4
query string — ``X-Amz-Date``, ``X-Amz-Expires``, ``X-Amz-Credential``, ``X-Amz-SignedHeaders`` —
is **covered by** ``X-Amz-Signature``, and the ``x-k8s-aws-id`` binding header is signed too. Two
consequences shape every test in this file:

* **Only the expiry is choosable.** ``mint_token(expires_in_seconds=N)`` sets ``X-Amz-Expires``
  at signing time. ``X-Amz-Date`` has no such knob — it is whatever the signer stamps as "now" —
  so the only honest way to age a token is to wait.
* **``retarget_token`` rewrites fields but never re-signs.** That is fine for every 401 case,
  because ``verify()`` runs its structural checks (host pin, action, expiry bounds, date bounds)
  BEFORE it contacts STS, so a broken signature is irrelevant to the assertion and costs no
  outbound call. It is useless for a 200: that needs STS to validate the signature, so the token
  must be genuinely signed and genuinely old — see
  ``test_token_within_clock_skew_allowance_is_accepted``, the one test here that sleeps.

The same asymmetry is why none of this is an attacker's tool. Re-dating or extending a *captured*
token invalidates the signature, so STS rejects the replay; the crafted cases below only ever
demonstrate the sidecar's own offline checks. The threat the expiry cap addresses is not forgery
but a legitimate client minting an over-long bearer credential — see
``test_token_with_unbounded_expiry_is_rejected_401``.
