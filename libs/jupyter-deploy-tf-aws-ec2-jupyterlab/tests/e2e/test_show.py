"""E2E tests for `jd show` — restricted to what THIS template declares.

Omitted: covered by the base template suite (`test_show.py`, 16 tests)
  Everything about how `jd show` *renders*: the variables/outputs list mechanics, single-line
  and multi-line descriptions, `--info` composition, `--reveal`, project-id / store-id /
  store-type plumbing, template-name and template-version lookup, and bare `jd show`. All of
  it is CLI-layer behavior, identical for every template, and additionally covered by
  `tests/unit/test_manifest_yaml.py` / `test_version.py`. Re-testing it here would buy nothing
  and cost a `jd init` + `jd config` (terraform init + plan) per test — the most expensive
  thing in this suite.

What is left is the four assertions that are about this template's declared surface: its
outputs set, its no-secrets invariant, and the two outputs the access path depends on.

    Derived from the manifest rather than checked against a hand-listed set: a literal list has to
    be maintained by hand and goes stale silently. The outputs named only in command *arguments*
    (the SSM document names) are covered where they are used — `test_server.py` for the `server_*`
    documents, `test_teams.py`/`test_users.py` for `auth_*_update_document`, `test_auth.py` for
