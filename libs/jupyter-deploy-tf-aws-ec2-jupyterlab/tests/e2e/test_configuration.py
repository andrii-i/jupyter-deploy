"""E2E configuration tests for the aws-ec2-jupyterlab template.

The whole point of this template is a zero-required-argument flow: `jd config` (terraform
plan) must succeed with no domain / OAuth / email variables. These tests therefore carry NO
``@skip_if_testvars_not_set`` decorators — they need AWS credentials, but no test env vars.

Omitted: covered by the base template suite (`test_configuration.py`, `test_config_set.py`,
`test_config_interactive.py`, `test_backward_compatibility.py` — ~30 tests)
  Every `jd config` error-recovery and value-plumbing path: invalid type, malformed YAML, stale
  store-id, list-dict non-nullification, `--verbose`, interactive error recovery, variable
  reset, `--set` for each variable type, and v1 -> v2 `variables.yaml` migration. All of it is
  CLI-layer behavior that does not vary by template, and each case costs a `jd init` plus a
  `terraform init` + `plan`. (The v1 migration is doubly moot here: a v1 `variables.yaml` for
  this template is an empty file.)

Kept: the zero-variable flow, the injected-flag surface (which IS template-specific — the flags
are generated from this template's variables), and the generated-file assertions.

Most tests share a module-scoped ``initialized_project`` / ``configured_project`` so the
expensive part happens a few times rather than once per test. Only the tests that themselves
run or drive `jd config` take their own throwaway project.

    makes "how do I undo it" a real question.

    The sentinel is the word `any` rather than an empty value because the CLI cannot express
    emptiness: `--availability-zone ""` is stored in variables.yaml as '""' and rendered into
    tfvars as a two-character zone name, so it pins garbage instead of clearing the pin. `any` is
    something a caller can actually type.

    Each `jd config` runs a real plan, so this covers the placement lookup end to end — and only a
    real plan does: `terraform validate` cannot catch the unknown-value and empty-list errors this
    path went through, because it never resolves the default VPC's subnets.
