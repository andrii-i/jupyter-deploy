"""E2E tests for application functionality — notebook execution in JupyterLab.

This template reaches JupyterLab through the local client proxy (no public URL, no OAuth),
so access goes through ``client_proxy_app`` rather than ``github_oauth_app``: it starts
``jd proxy start`` and points the browser at the loopback URL. There is no browser sign-in
and no ``--ci-dir`` bot credentials — the proxy injects the STS-identity token itself.
