"""E2E tests for CLI behavior on an undeployed project — proxy commands only.

Omitted: covered by the base template suite (`test_undeployed_project.py`, 4 tests)
  `jd open` / `jd show` / `jd show --info` / `jd show --variable` on an un-configured project.
  All four are CLI-layer graceful-failure behavior, template-independent, and each costs a
  `jd init` to assert.

Kept: the two `jd proxy` cases. The command group is new (#348) and its undeployed behavior is
covered nowhere — and it is the likeliest thing a user hits first, because on this template
`jd proxy start` is the access path, so running it before `jd up` is an easy mistake to make.
Both must fail with an actionable message, not a traceback: there are no outputs yet to resolve
an endpoint, a cert or a token from.
