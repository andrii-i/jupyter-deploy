"""E2E tests for `jd server` — the three services THIS template declares.

Every verb is wired through this template's own SSM documents and its own service set
(``jupyter``, ``traefik``, ``auth-sidecar``), so a manifest or document regression is a template
bug the base suite cannot catch. The service set is the substantive difference: base has
``oauth`` where this has ``auth-sidecar``, and only this template can observe an authorization
decision in a service log.

Omitted: covered by the base template suite (`test_server.py`)
  The pure CLI-mechanics cases: piped log arguments (`-- --tail 5` returning exactly 5 entries),
  default-service resolution for `exec`, and non-zero exit propagation from `server exec`. All
  three are argument-plumbing in the CLI layer, identical for every template.
